          "output": "Here are the requirements from the provided document:\n\nRequirement 1: Temperature rise test, Standard insulation values: The temperature rise test is performed immediately after the test to determine if the insulation level of the equipment meets the required standards.\n\nRequirement 2: Insulation levels, Standard insulation values: The standardized values of the highest voltage for equipment are divided in two ranges: Above 1 kV to 245 kV included (Table 3). This range covers both transmission and distribution systems, and different operational aspects shall be taken into account in the selection of the rated insulation level of the equipment.\n\nRequirement 3: Insulation levels, Standard insulation values: The standardized values of the highest voltage for equipment are divided in two ranges: Above 245 kV (Table 4). This range covers mainly transmission systems.\n\nRequirement 4: Temperature rise test, Measurement method: To measure the temperature of the windings, the resistance method shall be used.\n\nRequirement 5: Overload conditions, General: Overload is likely to occur in normal use, and generating sets which are tested in accordance with this part of ISO 8528 shall not suffer any damage as a result of an overload that could impair safety.\n\nRequirement 6: Overload conditions, Uncontrolled generator: For generating sets with uncontrolled generators, load limitation is provided by means of the speed and voltage reduction which occurs with increasing load. This mode of operation shall be checked at ambient conditions in accordance with Clause 5, and at rated power and rated power factor in accordance with 7.1; the generating set shall be loaded with active or apparent power to above its rated power until maximum power occurs or until the voltage drops to 0.8 rated voltage.\n\nRequirement 7: Overload conditions, Controlled generator: In the case of generating sets with controlled generators, the voltage also remains within set limits with increasing load. The power supplied by the generator increases in proportion to the load. It is necessary to protect a.c. generator against thermal overloading if underspeed occurs.\n\nRequirement 8: Improper operation, General: Generating sets may only be loaded up to rated power under the specified cooling and temperature conditions. If operating conditions do not conform to the reference conditions as stipulated in this part of ISO 8528 and if the cooling of the engine or the generator is impaired (e.g. as a result of a lack of proper maintenance), the equipment may be subjected to improper operation, which can lead to damage or failure of the equipment."

This range covers both transmission and distribution systems, and the different operational aspects shall be taken into account in the selection of the rated insulation level of the equipment.\n\nRequirement 6: Insulation levels\nThe standardized values of the highest voltage for equipment are divided in two ranges: Above 245 kV (Table 4). This range covers mainly transmission systems. Compliance shall be checked by a check of operating instructions.\n\nRequirement 6.5: Short circuits\nShort circuits on any of the electrical outputs of the generating set shall not cause mechanical or electrical damage that could impair safety. This also applies to electrical charging rectifiers, even in the event of reversal of polarity when connected to a charged battery.\n\nRequirement 6.5.2: Short circuits on output terminals\nWhere different rated voltages are possible, incorrect voltage selection shall not cause any consequential damage to the generating set. Compliance shall be checked by operating the generating set until stable conditions are established, while short court-circuiting output terminals or terminations and fuses which are accessible without the aid of a tool. Each check on incorrect running conditions shall be performed separately.\n\nRequirement 6.5.3: Controls\nControls which determine the specified engine speed shall be factory safeguarded by the manufacturer of the generating set against misuse by the user. Where sealing is not possible or if the connecting linkage between the speed governor and the actuator is accessible from the exterior, short-term overspeed to 1,2 times the rated speed shall not cause damage to the generating sets. Compliance shall be checked by visual inspection and one minute operation at 1,2 times rated speed.\n\nRequirement 7: Operating characteristics, power output, quality class, and fuel consumption\nThe standard reference conditions according to ISO 3046-1 and ISO 15550 are as follows: \u2014 ambient air temperature: 25 \u00b0C, 298 K; \u2014 ambient air pressure: 100 kPa; \u2014 relative humidity: 30%. The test conditions shall be according to Clause 5."
