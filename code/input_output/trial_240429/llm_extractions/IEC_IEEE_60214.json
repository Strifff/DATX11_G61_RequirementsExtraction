The change-over selector recovery voltages must be controlled to avoid difficultes with regard to dielectric stress and formation of gases (7.2.1.8.1).\n2. The winding design should prevent the maximum permissible switching parameters from being exceeded, either with or without any limiting devices installed (7.2.1.8.1).\n3. During transformer testing, the tap-changer change-over selector should be tested in accordance with IEC 60076-1:2011 to confirm satisfactory switching (7.2.1.8.2).\n4. The capacitances between the windings are often given as values taken from a measurement or can be calculated from the dimensions of the winding arrangement, and the transformer manufacturer shall provide these values (7.2.1.8.2).\n5. The stresses of the change-over selector have to be verified as acceptable by the tap-changer manufacturer (7.2.1.8.3).\n6. There are different methods to decrease the stresses on the opening change-over selector contacts, such as capacitance control and resistive control (7.2.1.8.3).\n7. The use of capacitance control can lead to voltage oscillations due to resonant conditions (7.2.1.8.3)."
