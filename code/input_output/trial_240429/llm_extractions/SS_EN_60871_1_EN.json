The warning plate shall conform to subclause 25.3.\n3. The guide for installation and operation shall include the following information:\n\t* Unlike most electrical apparatus, shunt capacitors, whenever energized, operate continuously at full load or at loads that deviate from this value only as a result of voltage and frequency variations.\n\t* Overstressing and overheating shorten the life of a capacitor, and therefore the operating conditions (i.e. temperature, voltage, and current) should be strictly controlled and specified.\n\t* The introduction of local capacitance in a system may produce unsatisfactory operating conditions (for example amplification of harmonics, self-excitation of machines, overvoltages due to switching, unsatisfactory working of audiofrequency remote control apparatus, etc.).\n\t* Because of the different types of capacitor and the many factors involved, it is not possible to cover, by simple rules, installation and operation in all possible cases. The following information is given with regard to the more important points to be considered:\n\t\t+ In addition, the recommendations of the manufacturer and the power supply authorities should be followed, especially those concerning the switching of capacitors when the network is under light load conditions.\n4. The rated voltage of the capacitor shall not be less than the maximum operating voltage of the network to which it is to be connected, account being taken of the influence of the capacitor itself."

The operating voltage of the network should be assumed as equal to the rated or declared voltage of the network, unless otherwise specified.\n2. Where inductive elements are inserted in series with the capacitor to reduce the effects of harmonics, etc., the resultant increase of the voltage at the capacitor terminals above the operating voltage of the network requires a corresponding increase in the rated voltage of the capacitor.\n3. Consideration should be taken into account for the effect of unit capacitance tolerance on the operating voltage in series or star-connected assemblies.\n4. The operation of capacitor fuses will also increase the operating voltage on the remaining parallel connected units.\n5. Attention should be paid to the upper operating temperature of the capacitor, because this has a great influence on its life.\n6. All loss-producing accessories, such as external fuses, reactors, etc., should be included in the calculation of total bank losses.\n7. Capacitors should be so placed that there is adequate dissipation by convection and radiation of the heat produced by the capacitor losses.\n8. The ventilation of any enclosure and the arrangement of the capacitor units shall provide good air circulation around each unit.\n9. The manufacturer should, by agreement, provide curves or tables showing the capacitance, as well as losses (tan \u03b4) under steady-state conditions at rated output, as a function of ambient temperature."

This range covers both transmission and distribution systems.\n\nRequirement 2: Insulation levels, Standard insulation values: The standardized values of the highest voltage for equipment are divided in two ranges: above 245 kV (Table 4). This range covers mainly transmission systems.\n\nRequirement 3: Capacitors subjected to radiation from the sun or from any high-temperature surface will be increased in temperature. Depending on the cooling air temperature, the intensity of the cooling and the intensity and duration of the radiation, it may be necessary to use one or more of the following remedies: protect the capacitors from radiation; choose a capacitor designed for a higher ambient air temperature (for example category \u20135/B instead of \u20135/A, or which is otherwise suitably designed); employ capacitors with rated voltage higher than that resulting from 27.2; employ forced air cooling.\n\nRequirement 4: Capacitors installed at high altitudes (more than 1 000 m) will be subject to decreased convective heat dissipation, which should be considered when determining the output of the units. The ambient temperature, however, is usually lower at such an altitude (see also 27.8.2).\n\nRequirement 5: High ambient air temperature capacitors for symbol C are generally suitable for the majority of applications under tropical conditions. In some locations, however, the ambient air temperature may be such that a symbol D capacitor is required. The latter may also be needed for those cases where the capacitors are frequently subjected to the radiation of the sun for several hours (for example in desert territories), even though the ambient temperature is not excessive.\n\nRequirement 6: In exceptional cases, the ambient air temperature may be higher than 55 \u00b0C maximum, or 45 \u00b0C daily mean. Where it is impossible to improve the cooling conditions, capacitors of special design or with a higher rated voltage should be used.\n\nRequirement 7: In addition to the conditions covered in 27.3, the manufacturer should be advised by the purchaser of any special service conditions such as: high relative humidity; rapid mould growth; corrosive atmospheres; pollution; altitudes exceeding 1 000 m; earthquake areas."
