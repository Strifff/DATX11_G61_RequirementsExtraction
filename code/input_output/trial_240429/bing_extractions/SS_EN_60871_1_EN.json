Here are the essential details:\n\nName of Manufacturer: This identifies the company responsible for producing the capacitor bank.\nRated Output (QN) in Megavars: The total output of the capacitor bank, expressed in megavars.\nRated Voltage (UN) in Kilovolts: The voltage at which the capacitor bank operates.\nInsulation Level (Ui): This is marked using two numbers separated by a stroke:\nThe first number represents the r.m.s. value of the rated power frequency short-duration voltage (for Um < 300 kV).\nThe second number represents the peak value of the rated lightning impulse withstand voltage (for example, 185/450) when Um ≥ 300 kV.\nConnection Symbol: Standardized symbols for connections (such as unbalance protection, damping reactors, etc.) may be included. Refer to section 25.2 for these symbols.\nMinimum Time Required for Disconnection and Reclosure: This information is crucial for safe operation (see section 4.1a and Annex D).\nTime to Discharge to 75 V: Applicable for banks rated above 25 kV.\n26.2 Warning Plate\nThe provisions of Subclause 25.3 also apply to the capacitor bank.\n\nInstallation and Operation Guidelines\n27.1 General\nShunt capacitors, when energized, operate continuously at full load or at loads that vary due to voltage and frequency fluctuations. To ensure longevity and proper functioning:\n\nStrictly Control Operating Conditions: Monitor temperature, voltage, and current.\nBeware of Local Capacitance Effects: Introducing local capacitance can lead to issues like harmonics amplification, self-excitation of machines, overvoltages during switching, and interference with audiofrequency remote control systems.\n27.2 Choosing the Rated Voltage\nThe rated voltage of the capacitor should not be less than the maximum operating voltage of the network. Consider the influence of the capacitor itself when making this choice.\n\nRemember that installation and operation specifics can vary based on capacitor types and other factors. Always follow manufacturer recommendations and power supply authority guidelines, especially when switching capacitors under light load conditions1."
