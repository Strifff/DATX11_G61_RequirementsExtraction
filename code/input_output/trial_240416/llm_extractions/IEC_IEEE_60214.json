If other media are used, a different lower limit will apply, and the tap-changer manufacturer should be consulted.\n\nRequirement 7.4.7.2: High temperature conditions\n\n* Oil temperatures exceeding the temperatures according to IEC 60214-1 and IEC 60076-7, or IEEE Std C57.131 and IEEE Std C57.91, could be considered by the application of a high temperature capable OLTC or will require limiting the number of operations per time unit and/or the number of continuous consecutive operations.\n* The important parameter for the limit in the number of operations is the liquid temperature inside the diverter or selector switch compartment of resistor type tap-changers.\n* NOTE 1 There is an upper limit for transformer top oil temperatures of 115\u00b0C under overload conditions, which applies to mineral oil in accordance with IEC 60076-7 or IEEE Std C57.91.\n\nRequirement 7.4.8: Overloading conditions\n\n* For the permissible overload current, refer to 7.2.1.3.2.\n* Overloading begins whenever any rated parameter of the tap-changer is exceeded.\n* Both overloading in terms of higher currents and higher voltage due to overexcitation should be considered.\n\nNote that these requirements are related to the temperature conditions of the tap-changer, and they provide guidelines for the selection and operation of the tap-changer to ensure its safe and reliable functioning."

Based on the provided document, the following requirements can be identified:\n\n1. The tap selectors, diverter switches, or selector switches located in separate containers outside the transformer tank or subjected to oil or SF6 temperatures lower than \u221225 \u00b0C during operation must be consulted with the manufacturer, taking into consideration the characteristics of the transformer and tap-changer insulation medium. (7.4.7.1)\n2. The lower limit of \u221225 \u00b0C applies to mineral oil in accordance with IEC 60296 or ASTM D3487, and this limit also applies to SF6 but with consideration of the pressure. (7.4.7.1)\n3. If necessary, automatically controlled heating devices could be provided or means of preventing tap-change operation at abnormally low temperatures can be considered. (7.4.7.1)\n4. The important parameter for the limit in the number of operations is the liquid temperature inside the diverter or selector switch compartment of resistor type tap-changers. (7.4.7.2)\n5. There is an upper limit for transformer top oil temperatures of 115 \u00b0C under overload conditions, which applies to mineral oil in accordance with IEC 60076-7 or IEEE Std C57.91. (NOTE 1)\n6. For gas-filled power transformers, an upper limit for transformer top gas temperature depends on operation conditions specifically agreed between the user and the tap-changer manufacturer. (NOTE 2)\n7. Overloading conditions begin whenever any rated parameter of the tap-changer is exceeded, and both overloading in terms of higher currents and higher voltage due to overexcitation should be considered. (7.4.8)\n8. The life time reduction of both the breaking contacts and current carrying contacts, as well as the insulating material, sets the limit. (NOTE 1)\n\nIt's important to note that these requirements are specific to the document provided and may not be applicable to all systems or situations."

This range covers both transmission and distribution systems. The different operational aspects, therefore, shall be taken into account in the selection of the rated insulation level of the equipment.\n\nRequirement 2: Insulation levels\nThe standardized values of the highest voltage for equipment are divided into two ranges: above 245 kV (Table 4). This range covers mainly transmission systems.\n\nRequirement 3: Operations with overvoltage\nOperations with an overexcited transformer core are allowed without restrictions to levels specified in IEC 60076-1 or IEEE Std C57.12.00. Operation at overexcitation exceeding these levels or operations with any overvoltage when exceeding rated load is not allowed. If such conditions are expected to occur, the tap-changer manufacturer shall be consulted.\n\nRequirement 4: Overloading\nFor loading conditions in demanding applications such as HVDC or industrial applications, for example, arc furnaces, it is recommended to consult the tap-changer manufacturer for assistance in the selection of a proper tap-changer for the actual service conditions.\n\nRequirement 5: Continuous consecutive operations\nIn some applications, continuous consecutive operations through part of or through the whole regulating range, or even more (e.g. HVDC applications), are required. In resistance-type tap-changers, substantial heat is generated in the transition resistors during switching and will be dissipated into and accumulated by the insulating fluid.\n\nRequirement 6: Preventive autotransformer circuit (reactor type tap-changer only)\nA preventive autotransformer is used with reactor type tap-changers as transition impedance to limit the circulating current when operating on a bridging position (service position where two adjacent taps are bridged), or during the change of taps between adjacent positions. A preventive autotransformer can also be energized in the non-bridging position (service position, with both movable contacts on the same fixed contact), where a circulating current will result if an equalizer winding is incorporated in the design. Preventive autotransformers are not components of the on-load tap-changer; they are designed and provided by the transformer manufacturer and are located in the transformer tank. The design limits of the OLTC have to be respected."

The overloads will normally accelerate the aging of the OLTC and transformer. (Functional aspect: aging of the OLTC and transformer)\n2. Contact erosion will increase, and current carrying contacts (especially those seldom or never operated) will experience loss of life time. (Non-functional aspect: contact erosion)\n3. Increased maintenance might be needed, especially for the non-vacuum types. (Functional aspect: maintenance)\n4. Operations with an overexcited transformer core are allowed without restrictions to levels specified in IEC 60076-1 or IEEE Std C57.12.00. (Functional aspect: operation at overexcitation)\n5. For loading conditions in demanding applications such as HVDC or industrial applications, for example, arc furnaces, it is recommended to consult the tap-changer manufacturer for assistance in the selection of a proper tap-changer for the actual service conditions. (Non-functional aspect: selection of tap-changer)\n6. For gas-filled power transformers, overloading condition is a factor of the transformer design and not defined generally. (Non-functional aspect: overloading condition)\n7. In some applications, continuous consecutive operations through part of or through the whole regulating range, or even more, are required. (Functional aspect: continuous consecutive operations)\n8. The heating of the insulating fluid will depend on a number of parameters such as number of positions, rating, load, fluid volume and type of tap-changer. (Non-functional aspect: heating of the insulating fluid)\n9. For continuous consecutive operations over more than half the typical regulating range, at overloads and/or at high transformer fluid temperatures, it is possible that the maximum permissible fluid temperature will be exceeded. (Functional aspect: maximum permissible fluid temperature)\n10. A preventive autotransformer is used with reactor type tap-changers as transition impedance to limit the circulating current when operating on a bridging position or during the change of taps between adjacent positions.
