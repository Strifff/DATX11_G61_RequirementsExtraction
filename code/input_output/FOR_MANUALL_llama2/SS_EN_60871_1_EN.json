The use of a two-way change-over selector is required.\n2. The amount of gases generated due to the change-over selector does not exceed any maximum leakage reactance levels or switching parameters declared by the tap-changer manufacturer.\n3. Axially disposed tap winding designs may lead to higher leakage induction values."
