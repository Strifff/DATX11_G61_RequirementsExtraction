The tap-changer manufacturer should consulted for low temperature conditions if the tap selectors, diverter switches or selector switches are located in separate containers outside the transformer tank or if the oil temperatures are lower than -25\u00b0C during operation.\n2. Oil temperatures exceeding those according to IEC 60214-1 and IEEE Std C57.131 could be considered by applying a high temperature capable OLTC or limiting the number of operations per time unit and/or the number of continuous consecutive operations.\n3. The important parameter for the limit in the number of operations is the liquid temperature inside the diverter or selector switch compartment of resistor type tap-changers.\n4. For gas-filled power transformers, an upper limit for transformer top gas temperature depends on operation conditions specifically agreed between the user and the tap-changer manufacturer.\n5. Overloading conditions begin whenever any rated parameter of the tap-changer is exceeded, and both overloading in terms of higher currents and higher voltage due to overexcitation should be considered.\n6. The life time reduction of both the breaking contacts and current carrying contacts, as well as the insulating material, set the limit for long run overloading."

          "output": "Here are the requirements mentioned in the provided document:\n\nRequirement 1: The transformer manufacturer should ensure that the design of the on-load tap-changer (OLTC) does not exceed any maximum leakage reactance levels or switching parameters declared by the tap-changer manufacturer.\n\nRequirement 2: It should be noted that axially disposed tap winding designs, as opposed to radially disposed designs, may lead to higher leakage induction values.\n\nRequirement 3: The transformer manufacturer should ensure that the winding design does not exceed any maximum leakage reactance levels or switching parameters declared by the tap-changer manufacturer.\n\nRequirement 4: For loading conditions in demanding applications such as HVDC or industrial applications, for example, arc furnaces, it is recommended to consult the tap-changer manufacturer for assistance in the selection of a proper tap-changer for the actual service conditions.\n\nRequirement 5: For gas-filled power transformers, overloading condition is a factor of the transformer design and not defined generally. For specific loading conditions and limitations, consult the SF6 insulated tap-changer manufacturer.\n\nRequirement 6: In some applications, continuous consecutive operations through part of or through the whole regulating range, or even more (e.g., HVDC applications), are required. In resistance-type tap-changers, substantial heat is generated in the transition resistors during switching and will be dissipated into and accumulated by the insulating fluid.\n\nRequirement 7: For continuous consecutive operations over more than half the typical regulating range, at overloads and/or at high transformer fluid temperatures, it is possible that the maximum permissible fluid temperature will be exceeded. The tap-changer manufacturer should be consulted with data required for a proper evaluation.\n\nRequirement 8: A preventive autotransformer is used with reactor type tap-changers as transition impedance to limit the circulating current when operating on a bridging position (service position where two adjacent taps are bridged), or during the change of taps between adjacent positions."

The DETC should be chosen to suit the requirements of the application, and the responsibility for the correct selection and application for the DETC for a given transformer lies with the manufacturer of the transformer. (Requirement 8.2.1.1)\n4. De-energized tap-changers in accordance with IEC 60214-1:2014, 7.2.2, or IEEE Std C57.131-2012, 7.2.2, meet the overload requirements of IEC 60076-7 or IEEE Std C57.91. (Requirement 8.2.1.2)\n5. When, for a particular application, a transformer is to be subjected to loading conditions in excess of the limitations in IEC 60076-7 or IEEE Std C57.91, the tap-changer manufacturer should be asked to recommend a suitably rated tap-changer. (Requirement 8.2.1.2)\n6. For gas-filled power transformers, overloading conditions are a factor of the transformer design and not defined generally, so the SF6 insulated tap-changer manufacturer should be consulted for specific loading conditions and limitations.
