The transformer should have a two-way change-over selector to prevent disconnection of the tap winding from the main winding.\n2. The amount of gases generated by the change-over selector operation should be in the range of a few millilitres per operation and affect the DGA of the transformer.\n3. The transformer manufacturer should ensure that the winding design does not exceed any maximum leakage reactance levels or switching parameters declared by the tap-changer manufacturer.\n4. Axially disposed tap winding designs may lead to higher leakage induction values."

They shall not project beyond the surrounding surface of the unit.\n\nRequirement 6: Except for extra low voltages, low voltages plug-and-socket connections according to IEC/TR 60083 (single phase) and IEC 60309 (multiphase), or relevant national standards, shall be applied. It shall not be possible to confuse plugs and socket outlets for very low voltage circuits with those plugs and socket outlets for low voltage circuits.\n\nRequirement 7: Screws and connections shall be designed in accordance with IEC 60335-1:2010, Clause 28. Compliance shall be checked in accordance with IEC 60335-1:2013, Clause 28.\n\nRequirement 8: During the operating of a generating set with given ratings, the permitted temperature limits shall not be exceeded. Thermal steady state condition is verified by measuring surface temperature of winding and/or lubricating oil temperature. The requirement is met if at average permitted power and for a minimum run of 60 min, the permitted values according to 6.3.2 and 6.3.3 are not exceeded.\n\nRequirement 9: During the test, the average permitted power for the generating set shall be maintained at a constant level."
